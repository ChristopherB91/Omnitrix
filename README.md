# Omnitrix

This is my Omnitrix app. There are 6 presets each with 10 aliens. Every alien from the show that was able to transform into an ultimate alien is able to go ultimate here. When you open it up first select which preset you would like then press the button below the omnitrix. Next select an alien from the preset and click on the omnitrix. If you selected the wrong preset press the red omnitrix. When you are shown a picture of the alien you can click the red ommnitrix to go back to the beginning. Depending on which alien you have chosen you maybe able to go ultimate. List of preset orginization and ultimate aliens(and there presets) down below.
